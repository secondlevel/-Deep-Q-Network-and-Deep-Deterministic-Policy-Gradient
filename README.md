# Deep-Q-Network-and-Deep-Deterministic-Policy-Gradient (Deep Learning and Practice homework 6)

The demo video can be seen in this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWXbZfipZzw)

This task is to implement two deep reinforcement algorithms by completing the following two tasks: 

**(1) solve LunarLander-v2 using deep Q-network (DQN)**  

**(2) solve LunarLanderContinuous-v2 using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG).**
